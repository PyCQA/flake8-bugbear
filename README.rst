A plugin for ``flake8`` finding likely bugs and design problems in your
program.  Contains warnings that don't belong in ``pyflakes`` and
``pycodestyle``::

    bug·bear  (bŭg′bâr′)
    n.
    1. A cause of fear, anxiety, or irritation: *Overcrowding is often
       a bugbear for train commuters.*
    2. A difficult or persistent problem: *"One of the major bugbears of
       traditional AI is the difficulty of programming computers to
       recognize that different but similar objects are instances of the
       same type of thing" (Jack Copeland).*
    3. A fearsome imaginary creature, especially one evoked to frighten
       children.

It is felt that these lints don't belong in the main Python tools as they
are very opinionated and do not have a PEP or standard behind them. Due to
``flake8`` being designed to be extensible, the original creators of these lints
believed that a plugin was the best route. This has resulted in better development
velocity for contributors and adaptive deployment for ``flake8`` users.

Installation
------------

Install from ``pip`` with:

.. code-block:: sh

     pip install flake8-bugbear

It will then automatically be run as part of ``flake8``; you can check it has
been picked up with:

.. code-block:: sh

    $ flake8 --version
    3.5.0 (assertive: 1.0.1, flake8-bugbear: 18.2.0, flake8-comprehensions: 1.4.1, mccabe: 0.6.1, pycodestyle: 2.3.1, pyflakes: 1.6.0) CPython 3.7.0 on Darwin

List of warnings
----------------

.. _B001:

**B001**: Do not use bare ``except:``, it also catches unexpected events
like memory errors, interrupts, system exit, and so on.  Prefer ``except
Exception:``.  If you're sure what you're doing, be explicit and write
``except BaseException:``.  Disable ``E722`` to avoid duplicate warnings.

.. _B002:

**B002**: Python does not support the unary prefix increment. Writing
``++n`` is equivalent to ``+(+(n))``, which equals ``n``. You meant ``n
+= 1``.

.. _B003:

**B003**: Assigning to ``os.environ`` doesn't clear the
environment.  Subprocesses are going to see outdated
variables, in disagreement with the current process.  Use
``os.environ.clear()`` or the ``env=``  argument to Popen.

.. _B004:

**B004**: Using ``hasattr(x, '__call__')`` to test if ``x`` is callable
is unreliable.  If ``x`` implements custom ``__getattr__`` or its
``__call__`` is itself not callable, you might get misleading
results.  Use ``callable(x)`` for consistent results.

.. _B005:

**B005**: Using ``.strip()`` with multi-character strings is misleading
the reader. It looks like stripping a substring. Move your
character set to a constant if this is deliberate. Use
``.replace()``, ``.removeprefix()``, ``.removesuffix()`` or regular
expressions to remove string fragments.

.. _B006:

**B006**: Do not use mutable data structures for argument defaults.  They
are created during function definition time. All calls to the function
reuse this one instance of that data structure, persisting changes
between them.

.. _B007:

**B007**: Loop control variable not used within the loop body.  If this is
intended, start the name with an underscore.

.. _B008:

**B008**: Do not perform function calls in argument defaults.  The call is
performed only once at function definition time. All calls to your
function will reuse the result of that definition-time function call.  If
this is intended, assign the function call to a module-level variable and
use that variable as a default value.

.. _B009:

**B009**: Do not call ``getattr(x, 'attr')``, instead use normal
property access: ``x.attr``. Missing a default to ``getattr`` will cause
an ``AttributeError`` to be raised for non-existent properties. There is
no additional safety in using ``getattr`` if you know the attribute name
ahead of time.

.. _B010:

**B010**: Do not call ``setattr(x, 'attr', val)``, instead use normal
property access: ``x.attr = val``. There is no additional safety in
using ``setattr`` if you know the attribute name ahead of time.

.. _B011:

**B011**: Do not call ``assert False`` since ``python -O`` removes these calls.
Instead callers should ``raise AssertionError()``.

.. _B012:

**B012**: Use of ``break``, ``continue`` or ``return`` inside ``finally`` blocks will
silence exceptions or override return values from the ``try`` or ``except`` blocks.
To silence an exception, do it explicitly in the ``except`` block. To properly use
a ``break``, ``continue`` or ``return`` refactor your code so these statements are not
in the ``finally`` block.

.. _B013:

**B013**: A length-one tuple literal is redundant.  Write ``except SomeError:``
instead of ``except (SomeError,):``.

.. _B014:

**B014**: Redundant exception types in ``except (Exception, TypeError):``.
Write ``except Exception:``, which catches exactly the same exceptions.

.. _B015:

**B015**: Pointless comparison. This comparison does nothing but
waste CPU instructions. Either prepend ``assert`` or remove it.

.. _B016:

**B016**: Cannot raise a literal. Did you intend to return it or raise
an Exception?

.. _B017:

**B017**: ``assertRaises(Exception)`` and ``pytest.raises(Exception)`` should
be considered evil. They can lead to your test passing even if the
code being tested is never executed due to a typo. Assert for a more
specific exception (builtin or custom), or use ``assertRaisesRegex``
(if using ``assertRaises``), or add the ``match`` keyword argument (if
using ``pytest.raises``), or use the context manager form with a target
(e.g. ``with self.assertRaises(Exception) as ex:``).

.. _B018:

**B018**: Found useless expression. Either assign it to a variable or remove it.
Note that dangling commas will cause things to be interpreted as useless tuples.
For example, in the statement ``print(".."),`` is the same as ``(print(".."),)``
which is an unassigned tuple. Simply remove the comma to clear the error.

.. _B019:

**B019**: Use of ``functools.lru_cache`` or ``functools.cache`` on methods
can lead to memory leaks. The cache may retain instance references, preventing
garbage collection.

.. _B020:

**B020**: Loop control variable overrides iterable it iterates

.. _B021:

**B021**: f-string used as docstring. This will be interpreted by python
as a joined string rather than a docstring.

.. _B022:

**B022**: No arguments passed to `contextlib.suppress`.
No exceptions will be suppressed and therefore this context manager is redundant.
N.B. this rule currently does not flag `suppress` calls to avoid potential false
positives due to similarly named user-defined functions.

.. _B023:

**B023**: Functions defined inside a loop must not use variables redefined in
the loop, because `late-binding closures are a classic gotcha
<https://docs.python-guide.org/writing/gotchas/#late-binding-closures>`__.

.. _B024:

**B024**: Abstract base class has methods, but none of them are abstract. This
is not necessarily an error, but you might have forgotten to add the @abstractmethod
decorator, potentially in conjunction with @classmethod, @property and/or @staticmethod.

.. _B025:

**B025**: ``try-except`` block with duplicate exceptions found.
This check identifies exception types that are specified in multiple ``except``
clauses. The first specification is the only one ever considered, so all others can be removed.

.. _B026:

**B026**: Star-arg unpacking after a keyword argument is strongly discouraged, because
it only works when the keyword parameter is declared after all parameters supplied by
the unpacked sequence, and this change of ordering can surprise and mislead readers.
There was `cpython discussion of disallowing this syntax
<https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82741>`_, but legacy usage and parser
limitations make it difficult.

.. _B027:

**B027**: Empty method in abstract base class, but has no abstract decorator. Consider adding @abstractmethod.

.. _B028:

**B028**: No explicit stacklevel argument found. The warn method from the warnings module uses a
stacklevel of 1 by default. This will only show a stack trace for the line on which the warn method is called.
It is therefore recommended to use a stacklevel of 2 or greater to provide more information to the user.
The check is skipped when skip_file_prefixes is used.

.. _B029:

**B029**: Using ``except ():`` with an empty tuple does not handle/catch anything. Add exceptions to handle.

.. _B030:

**B030**: Except handlers should only be exception classes or tuples of exception classes.

.. _B031:

**B031**: Using the generator returned from `itertools.groupby()` more than once will do nothing on the
second usage. Save the result to a list if the result is needed multiple times.

.. _B032:

**B032**: Possible unintentional type annotation (using ``:``). Did you mean to assign (using ``=``)?

.. _B033:

**B033**: Sets should not contain duplicate items. Duplicate items will be replaced with a single item at runtime.

.. _B034:

**B034**: Calls to `re.sub`, `re.subn` or `re.split` should pass `flags` or `count`/`maxsplit` as keyword arguments. It is commonly assumed that `flags` is the third positional parameter, forgetting about `count`/`maxsplit`, since many other `re` module functions are of the form `f(pattern, string, flags)`.

.. _B035:

**B035**: Found dict comprehension with a static key - either a constant value or variable not from the comprehension expression. This will result in a dict with a single key that was repeatedly overwritten.

.. _B036:

**B036**: Found ``except BaseException:`` without re-raising (no ``raise`` in the top-level of the ``except`` block). This catches all kinds of things (Exception, SystemExit, KeyboardInterrupt...) and may prevent a program from exiting as expected.

.. _B037:

**B037**: Found ``return <value>``, ``yield``, ``yield <value>``, or ``yield from <value>`` in class ``__init__()`` method. No values should be returned or yielded, only bare ``return``\s are ok.

.. _B038:

**B038**: **Moved to B909** - Found a mutation of a mutable loop iterable inside the loop body. Changes to the iterable of a loop such as calls to `list.remove()` or via `del` can cause unintended bugs.

.. _B039:

**B039**: ``ContextVar`` with mutable literal or function call as default. This is only evaluated once, and all subsequent calls to `.get()` would return the same instance of the default. This uses the same logic as B006 and B008, including ignoring values in ``extend-immutable-calls``.

.. _B040:

**B040**: Caught exception with call to ``add_note`` not used. Did you forget to ``raise`` it?

**B041**: Repeated key-value pair in dictionary literal. Only emits errors when the key's value is *also* the same, being the opposite of the pyflakes like check.

**B042**: Remember to call super().__init__() in custom exceptions initalizer.

Opinionated warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following warnings are disabled by default because they are
controversial.  They may or may not apply to you, enable them explicitly
in your configuration if you find them useful.  Read below on how to
enable.

.. _B901:

**B901**: Using ``return x`` in a generator function used to be
syntactically invalid in Python 2. In Python 3 ``return x`` can be used
in a generator as a return value in conjunction with ``yield from``.
Users coming from Python 2 may expect the old behavior which might lead
to bugs.  Use native ``async def`` coroutines or mark intentional
``return x`` usage with ``# noqa`` on the same line.

.. _B902:

**B902**: Invalid first argument used for method. Use ``self`` for
instance methods, and ``cls`` for class methods (which includes ``__new__``
and ``__init_subclass__``) or instance methods of metaclasses (detected as
classes directly inheriting from ``type``).

.. _B903:

**B903**: Use ``collections.namedtuple`` (or ``typing.NamedTuple``) for
data classes that only set attributes in an ``__init__`` method, and do
nothing else. If the attributes should be mutable, define the attributes
in ``__slots__`` to save per-instance memory and to prevent accidentally
creating additional attributes on instances.

.. _B904:

**B904**: Within an ``except`` clause, raise exceptions with ``raise ... from err``
or ``raise ... from None`` to distinguish them from errors in exception handling.
See `the exception chaining tutorial <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html#exception-chaining>`_
for details.

.. _B905:

**B905**: ``zip()`` without an explicit `strict=` parameter set. ``strict=True`` causes the resulting iterator
to raise a ``ValueError`` if the arguments are exhausted at differing lengths.

Exclusions are `itertools.count <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.count>`_, `itertools.cycle <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle>`_ and `itertools.repeat <https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat>`_ (with times=None) since they are infinite iterators.

The ``strict=`` argument was added in Python 3.10, so don't enable this flag for code that should work on <3.10.
For more information: https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/

.. _B906:

**B906**: ``visit_`` function with no further call to a ``visit`` function. This is often an error, and will stop the visitor from recursing into the subnodes of a visited node. Consider adding a call ``self.generic_visit(node)`` at the end of the function.
Will only trigger on function names where the part after ``visit_`` is a valid ``ast`` type with a non-empty ``_fields`` attribute.
This is meant to be enabled by developers writing visitors using the ``ast`` module, such as flake8 plugin writers.

.. _B907:

**B907**: Consider replacing ``f"'{foo}'"`` with ``f"{foo!r}"`` which is both easier to read and will escape quotes inside ``foo`` if that would appear. The check tries to filter out any format specs that are invalid together with ``!r``. If you're using other conversion flags then e.g. ``f"'{foo!a}'"`` can be replaced with ``f"{ascii(foo)!r}"``. Not currently implemented for python<3.8 or ``str.format()`` calls.

.. _B908:

**B908**: Contexts with exceptions assertions like ``with self.assertRaises`` or ``with pytest.raises`` should not have multiple top-level statements. Each statement should be in its own context. That way, the test ensures that the exception is raised only in the exact statement where you expect it.

.. _B909:

**B909**: **Was B038** - Found a mutation of a mutable loop iterable inside the loop body. Changes to the iterable of a loop such as calls to `list.remove()` or via `del` can cause unintended bugs.

.. _B910:

**B910**: Use Counter() instead of defaultdict(int) to avoid excessive memory use as the default dict will record missing keys with the default value when accessed.

.. _B911:

**B911**: ``itertools.batched()`` without an explicit `strict=` parameter set. ``strict=True`` causes the resulting iterator to raise a ``ValueError`` if the final batch is shorter than ``n``.

The ``strict=`` argument was added in Python 3.13, so don't enable this flag for code that should work on <3.13.

.. _B912:

**B912**: ``map()`` without an explicit `strict=` parameter set. ``strict=True`` causes the resulting iterator
to raise a ``ValueError`` if the arguments are exhausted at differing lengths.

.. _B950:

**B950**: Line too long. This is a pragmatic equivalent of
``pycodestyle``'s ``E501``: it considers "max-line-length" but only triggers
when the value has been exceeded by **more than 10%**. ``noqa`` and ``type: ignore`` comments are ignored. You will no
longer be forced to reformat code due to the closing parenthesis being
one character too far to satisfy the linter. At the same time, if you do
significantly violate the line length, you will receive a message that
states what the actual limit is. This is inspired by Raymond Hettinger's
`"Beyond PEP 8" talk <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wf-BqAjZb8M>`_ and
highway patrol not stopping you if you drive < 5mph too fast. Disable
``E501`` to avoid duplicate warnings. Like ``E501``, this error ignores long shebangs
on the first line and urls or paths that are on their own line::

  #! long shebang ignored

  # https://some-super-long-domain-name.com/with/some/very/long/paths
  url = (
      "https://some-super-long-domain-name.com/with/some/very/long/paths"
  )


How to enable opinionated warnings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable Bugbear's opinionated checks (``B9xx``), specify an ``--extend-select``
command-line option or ``extend-select=`` option in your config file
(requires ``flake8 >=4.0``)::

  [flake8]
  max-line-length = 80
  max-complexity = 12
  ...
  extend-ignore = E501
  extend-select = B950

Some of Bugbear's checks require other ``flake8`` checks disabled - e.g. ``E501`` must
be disabled when enabling ``B950``.

If you'd like all optional warnings to be enabled for you (future proof your config!),
say ``B9`` instead of ``B950``. You will need ``flake8 >=3.2`` for this feature.

For ``flake8 <=4.0``, you will need to use the ``--select`` command-line option or
``select=`` option in your config file. For ``flake8 >=3.0``, this option is a whitelist
(checks not listed are implicitly disabled), so you have to explicitly specify all
checks you want enabled (e.g. ``select = C,E,F,W,B,B950``).

The ``--extend-ignore`` command-line option and ``extend-ignore=`` config file option
require ``flake8 >=3.6``. For older ``flake8`` versions, the ``--ignore`` and
``ignore=`` options can be used. Using ``ignore`` will override all codes that are
disabled by default from all installed linters, so you will need to specify these codes
in your configuration to silence them. I think this behavior is surprising so Bugbear's
opinionated warnings require explicit selection.

**Note:** Bugbear's enforcement of explicit opinionated warning selection is deprecated
and will be removed in a future release. It is recommended to use ``extend-ignore`` and
``extend-select`` in your ``flake8`` configuration to avoid implicitly altering selected
and/or ignored codes.

Configuration
-------------

The plugin currently has the following settings:

.. _extend_immutable_calls:

``extend-immutable-calls``: Specify a list of additional immutable calls.
This could be useful, when using other libraries that provide more immutable calls,
beside those already handled by ``flake8-bugbear``. Calls to these method will no longer
raise a ``B008`` or ``B039`` warning.

.. _classmethod_decorators:

``classmethod-decorators``: Specify a list of decorators to additionally mark a method as a ``classmethod`` as used by B902. The default only checks for ``classmethod``. When an ``@obj.name`` decorator is specified it will match against either ``name`` or ``obj.name``.
This functions similarly to how `pep8-naming <https://github.com/PyCQA/pep8-naming>` handles it, but with different defaults, and they don't support specifying attributes such that a decorator will never match against a specified value ``obj.name`` even if decorated with ``@obj.name``.

For example::

  [flake8]
  max-line-length = 80
  max-complexity = 12
  ...
  extend-immutable-calls = pathlib.Path, Path
  classmethod-decorators = myclassmethod, mylibrary.otherclassmethod
